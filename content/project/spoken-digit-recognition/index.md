Classification Methods for Audio MNIST Dataset

Dataset consists of recordings of spoken digits in wav files at 8kHz. The recordings are trimmed so that they have near minimal silence at the beginnings and ends.

The Samples recorded by 4 speakers with English pronunciations and there are totally 2,000 recordings (50 of each digit per speaker) in the dataset.

Files are named in the following format: {digitLabel}{speakerName}{index}.wav Example: 7_jackson_32.wav
